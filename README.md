Hey there! I'm Thalissa a brazilian student, nice to meet ya :)

 ⚡ I study systems and program development for around a year now.
 ⚡ And i enjoy both the back-end and the front-end and I think the whole process of developing
fascinating, the irony of fate is that two years ago I hated
anything related to technology and nowadays it's one of my favorites topics
:)
⚡My pronouns are: She/Her
